         &emsp;This website is intended to act as an additional tool for an
         existing college class registration system, to simulate this,
         we ask all users to select a major when they register for our website.
         The major you choose will then be used to randomly generate a mock
         class schedule for you. This mock schedule is a key element in order
         to demonstrate the true functionality of our website.
      </p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="help-info">
      <p>
         &emsp;After registering for our website, you will be shown your
         generated schedule, and given the option to regenerate your schedule
         if you wish. Once you confirm your schedule, you will be taken to the
         book selection page. Each book on this page is gathered according to the
         textbook needs of the classes in your schedule. Here you can choose to
         remove any books which you may already own, or have chosen to purchase
         elsewhere.

         &emsp;Once you finish choosing which textbooks to order, you will be
         brought to the checkout page. On this page you will be given the
         option to rent or buy both new or used textbooks. After choosing your
         textbook purchasing preferences, you will be asked if you would like to
         have your order either picked up or delivered. Once you confirm your order
         you will move one to the payment process after that you are done!
